Informally, the [Levenshtein distance](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance>) between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.

Informally, the [Damerau–Levenshtein distance](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance>) between two words is the minimum number of operations (consisting of insertions, deletions or substitutions of a single character, or transposition of two adjacent characters) required to change one word into the other.

In computer science and statistics, the [Jaro–Winkler distance](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance>) is a string metric measuring an edit distance between two sequences.
